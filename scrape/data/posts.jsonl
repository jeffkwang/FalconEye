It made me feel so isolated and hated."

He’s insistent. He’s pushy. He looks threatening. I’m scared and I see that you’re scared too. We try to rebuff him. When the bus arrives, he also hops on. You and I sit together because the bus is almost empty. He follows us to our seats. He continues to try to get us to talk. Personal details. Are you students? Where do you live? When he leaves after 40 minutes, you and I are so relieved that we start laughing. You’ve been glancing at your cell phone like me. You’ve been worried that he wants to take the same train too.Later, we get on the train but we continue talking. We talk for over two hours. About our problems and our plans. Our earlier experience makes us open up. Just a little before the train arrives at its destination, you bring up your girlfriend. You look at me, in that moment, with a wary, fearful look. And you wait for my reaction. I realize I’m familiar with that look. I’m a queer woman of color too. I look the same way when I bring my girlfriend up to another person for the first time: distrustful, fearful, waiting for rejection."

My friends and I proceed to talk about how little kids are the only ones who can get away with looking cute in crocs (just joking around, you know), and then we realise that maybe the little girl’s mom has noticed us looking at her daughter and that she might be creeped out or whatever. We’ve since looked away, still chuckling, when all of a sudden my friend’s mom says this: “No, she probably looks so focused because she’s doing trigonometry, calculus, and algebra in her head all at the same time, cause that’s how *their* brains work”."

Because of the slightly imprecise language in the application (restricting the pool of potential candidates to ‘African-Americans’), this friend received his scholarship. The acquaintance then notes that the scholarship board promptly changed that language the next year to better reflect their aims (helping a disproportionately underrepresented minority enter a white-dominated field). She reports this quite ironically, like the board are being spoilsports, and is usually just a breath away from wondering where the White Person scholarships are. I am astounded by how much delight reporting this anecdote brings her. She honestly believes the outcome was not only just, but that it struck a mighty blow to PC do-gooders."

I nodded my head. He asked one more time, “You sure you can drive a stick?”  I’m a 27-year-old mixed-ethnicity (Asian/write) female and this was in a college town.

I know bars can be frustrating and stressful on a bartender, but this one was barely half full. I know I’m privileged enough to be even writing this, but sometimes I don’t know how else to respond to these acts of microaggressions. I’m too hurt to even be angry. I just wish people would be more mindful sometimes; I know you didn’t mean it and I’m probably overreacting and should have a thicker skin, but these things really get to me sometime…. :( I’m a gay person of color.

So, I leave the purse there and go back to my desk, which is right by the conference room door. The owner of the purse shows up shortly and the woman, in my hearing, tells the other woman, the owner of the purse, “Your bag almost got stolen!” (Now why would I steal a purse, from a conference room, in front of an entire group of people assembled for a meeting? Why? Oh, I get it, because I’m black!!!! So that’s why I’m not only likely to be a thief, I’m likely to be a stupid thief!)"

I am not ashamed of my background. It angers me that people feel the need to know my ethnic background when they know nothing else about me. As though my appearance is just a guessing game.
