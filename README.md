# FalconEye

FalconEye is a project using sentiment analysis tools to identify microaggressions online. We analyze postings from
alt-social media sites like Truth Social and Gab. The inspiration behind this project comes from the recent election
of Donald Trump as president. Many far right organizations align with him, so they may have more agency to act during this period of time. We hypothesize there will be an increase in microaggressions in general, and our project intends to demonstrate whether this is the case. We leverage Google's NLP API and machine learning techniques to analyze online conversations and provide insights into the prevalence and types of microaggressions in digital spaces.
