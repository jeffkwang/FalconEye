1, I am an Asian woman. It’s Halloween today and I walked by a white woman dressed as a geisha, with her face painted and hair darkened. We made and held eye contact for a few seconds, and I think she looked embarrassed. It made me feel me angrier somehow. If it was so easy for her to recognize that this was an embarrassing thing to do, why did she still do it?
2, A friend and I are talking about what it would be like if I got dreads. I tell him there’s no way my parents would let me have them. In response he says, “They’d probably be glad you’re finally doing something black!” How the hell is some South Asian kid going to tell me what it is to be black? It’s not the first time someone had the gall to presume they knew more about my race than me just because I’m not down with the latest rap music and get good grades, either.
3, When my father (who is Mexican) picks me up from school, the people in the office assumes he is the gardener or custodian. The yard duties are also not as kind to him like how they treat the white parents.
4, In Houston, there is a nasty, classist habit of deliberately mispronouncing Spanish-language names and words. I used to hear people who self-defined as “upper class” mispronounce “San Felipe” (a street) as “Sen Flippy”, mispronounce the names of Latino/as to their face, and pretend in Mexican restaurants to not know how to pronounce the items the menu (really? they’re Texas-born adults and they can’t say “enchiladas”?).
5, *first week of freshman year of college*a white girl from a dorm room across the hall from me starts talking about the James Scholar Honors awarded to some students upon acceptance to the university.Me: “yeah I am a James Scholar, actually”Her: *shocked* “Oh really? Is it because you are Hispanic?”I graduated at the top of my high school class, with extracurricular activities in music, sports and philanthropy with several leadership positions.We are both sophomores now and I have a higher GPA than her, but she still questions how I get my (merit-based) scholarships and honors.
6, I am a Latina engineering student. I have been working on a semester-long group project We just presented our design in front of judges who are professional engineers from around the area. I have two group mates: a female immigrant from Korea and a white male. After one presentation, one of the judges of a company for which we all want to intern approached my white male peer and congratulated him on the project and handed him a business card. He did not look at me nor my Asian-American female group mate. We all worked equally on the project. Made me feel as if my contributions will never be worthy of recognition.
7, Back in high school, I was trying to drop an AP course as it was adding onto the stress of college applications. A lot of the class had already dropped the course but somehow my form hadn’t gotten approved. I ran into my principal one day in the hall. Now my high school was fairly small, but I had never interacted with her much so I don’t believe she even knew my name. I asked her why my form hadn’t gotten approved and she looked at me and said, “This isn’t the Taj Mahal, you can’t just drop courses like that.” I’m very obviously not white, and her reply left me stunned because I just didn’t get it. After talking it over with my friends, they made me realize she had said that because of the brown color of my skin. I felt disgusted that someone with so much influence felt okay saying that to a kid.
8, My fiancee and I are never acknowledged as a couple, and I think this is because we are both feminine women and different races. Waiters consistently bring us separate checks without asking, shopkeepers at places we are regulars usually eventually ask “so are you two sisters? is that why you are always together?"
9, I’m a bartender, chatting with a customer. He asks me about my background, and I respond that I’m “mixed,” obviously implying that i don’t really want to discuss it (I get asked this all the time). He pushes it, saying “yeah, obviously, but mixed with what?” When I finally tell him that I’m half white and half aboriginal, he responds with “so THAT’S why-” before cutting himself off mid-sentence. This is the same man who, when he first met me, asked I was the daughter of my Indo-Trinidadian manager, the only other POC [person of color] in the room.
10, It angers me when people measure my race by the way I talk, dress, and carry myself. It’s as if black women can’t possibly be educated and come from a family with both parents. What sucks the most is that my close friends still say comments like “you’re not really black,” or “but they’re the other kind of black girls.” Can someone please tell me what other black there is?
11, My friend and I are standing in like at the supermarket and a young white female who’s telling her boyfriend a story pauses when she sees my friend, who so happens to be black. She then continues her story to her boyfriend with “not to be racist, but she was black.” Had my friend not been there I’m assuming she wouldn’t have started her sentence with “not to be racist, but…”
12, Last week when getting of the city bus to go to work, a random older man starting yelling “F****** n*****!” repeatedly as we both got off. I was shocked. Two people stood at the corner just watching. (Editors’ note: racial slurs are not really microaggressions, but harassment in everyday places and apathetic bystanders are definitely part and parcel of microaggressions and their contexts).
13, When my group of white friends,whenever they discuss getting a job, “jokingly” bring up claims to mixed ancestry to try and improve their chances of hire.
14, I, an Asian girl, was waiting with my mother on line in a New York County Court with a Hispanic family in front of us. A white male that was working there walked past us, completely ignored us and greeted another white male that was on line behind us with “How can I help you, sir?” Keep in mind we were all fluent in English.
15, We are learning American history in college. We are focused on slavery and the Civil War during the lead up to the 2014 referendum. After the results a white, yes (Brexit) -voting classmate cries that “I was trying to free us from slavery like blacks were in slavery.” This was after we studied several slave narratives which clearly illustrated the horrors that black people had to endure. Several other classmates nag the teacher about “why we don’t sussed like the South did.”
16, Today at work, there was a Latino father and his children. Like children, they were playing and running around the store. My white boss comes up to me and says “Hispanic people have absolutely no control over their kids.”
17, My husband and I are both African American and have been together for over two years now. I have always known that he had previously dated a lot of women of other ethnicities. However, I was extremely shocked when he told me that he had always avoided black women in particular because they can be “loud and aggressive” and that he was happy that I wasn’t like that all the time. He refused my rebuttal that there are women like that in all cultures. While I don’t question his love for me, it is a constant worry that maybe he will find another woman who has all the same favorable qualities that I have but with fair skin, straight hair and light eyes. It drives me crazy that my appearance, his own appearance, is not the one he finds attractive.
18, I live in a European country. I am mixed black and white. I was overjoyed when I made another similarly mixed acquaintance. Until I realized she calls all Asians “Chinese” and states “they’re all the same to me.” I tried to reason with her several times but she just doesn’t want to get why her comments are racist and unacceptable. She even called my Nepalese/German sister-in-law “Chinese” straight into her face, who was really offended (not because it’s bad being Chinese, but due to this stereotyping). I am so shocked she doesn’t know better and only realizes racism when it refers to herself.
19, Office setting.  Insurance claims.  First day on job.  Three co-workers quote Shakespeare throughout the day.  Ask me if I studied Shakespeare in college and I replied “no.”  They roll their eyes and someone comments: You have a normal name, Barbara. I am African American. I felt patronized.
20, The honor roll certificates are being given out in alphabetical order at my school. During a streak of Patels, one kid shouts “We all know they’ll all get As anyway! Who cares?"
21, I’m an Asian woman. Whenever there is another Asian woman in my workplace, I inevitably get called by her name, multiple times a day. One day, my write colleague told me “You should realize how hard this is for me and stop caring so much!” after calling me the other Asian girl’s name. Saying “I’m trying!” or “you know it’s not racist” doesn’t help when you’re not trying and it IS racist.
22, I am trying to get my fingerprints done at the first precinct in Virginia Beach so that I can complete a practicum experience with the court system in the fall. On my form I left my race blank because I equally identify as Latina and Asian. Before I even get to explain to the clerk why the space, which would allow for one letter, was blank, she chastises me for leaving it blank. I explain that I am biracial and that I don’t know what to put down because I don’t see a list of options for me to pick from. She rudely asks me “Well what are you? What are you?!” repeatedly. I calmly explain that I am equal parts Latina and Asian again, and she hastily replies “We’re just going to put Asian.” without my consent and without even attempting to see if there is a way for me to accurately document my identity.
23, It’s a few years ago, but I am waiting on the NYC  subway when this young white man gets off the train wearing a T-shirt that says, “If we had known it was going to be this much trouble, we would have picked the cotton ourselves.”  As a young black woman, you can imagine my total offense to his shirt and the message he sent to anybody and everybody who could read.
24, When entering an elevator with white people and I am the only woman of color, I quickly press the button correlated with the floor I need and slide backwards away from the buttons to avoid the entitlement of someone casually and rudely demanding I press the floor they need without so much as a thank you. I am not the elevator operator. Further, their index fingers appear to be fully functionally. #idonotworkforyou
25, When I started working in my first industry role, I felt pretty grown up. But not only was I sexually harassed throughout my time there, I got told that I was the ‘ethnic diversity’ of the company. When I left they said they’d have to hire another non-white person to keep it balanced.
26, When I asked for a promotion my colleagues assert that the graduate students are “afraid of me.” This is not reflected in my teaching reviews or conversations with the many great graduate students in the department. It is enough for them to just say this, with no evidence, to deny promotion. They are straight and white. I am not.
27, Enjoying a family reunion with my husbands family.  I am the only one ethnically different - Hispanic.  I received a bug bite on my cheek with a significant swelling and redness. My sister-in-law of Swedish decent says, “I’m surprised someone like you with such dark skin is so sensitive.  I didn’t think dark skin was as sensitive as light skin.”
28, My husband and I had just moved to Dallas. We went for a walk in a historic shopping district where we came upon a man and his son playing guitars. They sounded really good so we put a $5 bill in their tip jar. Almost immediately, the son pipes up, “I thought Black people only liked rap music!” The father laughed nervously and said his son was just joking. I wanted to snatch my $5 bill back, but we just walked away.
29, I’m biracial, and visibly ‘foreign looking’. I’ve been living in Denmark for nearly 3 years now, and German is taught as a second foreign language, so I’ve been learning German from scratch for 3 years. Every teacher I’ve had (I’ve had 3) is either suprised I can do well at German, and two have both, at least once, singled me out in the class in accusations of plagiarism in regards to German assignments, because it was deemed unlikely that I was capable of writing the material myself.
30, Sometimes when I say I’m from Detroit, people’s tone of voice becomes uneasy. They might even cringe. One even said that they never guessed, as though where one lives should be obvious. It’s a shame that people think I’m a criminal just because of where I live.
31, In an elective class in high school, a group of us students were talking about laws regarding sexting. I asked hypothetically if I would get in trouble if I had naked pictures of myself in my backpack. The teacher who was near me, muttered  "that’s not what you’d have in your backpack" I was genuinely confused as to what he was getting at, and asked him what he meant, he said “oh you know what I mean” and just to make sure there was zero ambiguity he added “a bomb!” Growing up south Asian in a small town in the south, I was used to being made to feel guilty because of my ethnicity and presumed religious beliefs, but something about how blatant and irrelevant to the conversation his comment was, really affected me. It made me feel so isolated and hated.
32, In a class during junior year of high school, our teacher was showing us pictures of skylines from various countries. One of the pictures was incorrectly labeled Mumbai. When I corrected her and said it was actually a picture of Dubai in the United Arab Emirates , no one reacted. Thinking I might not have been loud enough I said it again. A classmate next to me accusatorially asked me why I knew that. Apparently even knowing basic geography about the Middle East is suspicious if you’re brown.
33, I work in an establishment that has a lot of Spanish speaking clients mainly of Mexican origin. Many people assume that since I’m Black I can’t possibly be able to assist them in Spanish. People even make crude racial remarks and feel totally safe doing so because they assume I don’t understand. I’ll usually let them totally expose their ignorance before greeting them in perfect Spanish. Their reactions are often priceless. I’m often extra nice to the people that say the meanest things just to show them a different side of Black people than the nasty brutes they think we are.
34, I am describing for my management colleagues the fact that I as a white woman no longer feel comfortable with my African American teenage son coming to our workplace because concerns about “security” have led colleagues to question why certain people are in our workplaces which makes the experience of people of color, like my son, very negative.  A white colleagues says, “We should document all the experiences people have so that we can demonstrate the problem.”  An African American colleague notes, “If it has happened once, it is a problem.” The white colleague says, “Well, if you can’t document it, good luck addressing it.”  Not supportive, and a reminder that proving racism is a problem is still necessary for those who do not directly experience it and believe their view of the world is of greater significance than the story those of us who are marginalized experience.
35, Why do people feel like it’s appropriate to randomly touch or feel my hair? Especially in public. I feel like it violates my personal space and the other person actually gets surprised when I react when they do it. There was one instance where someone actually wanted to see how much I reacted to them touching my hair and had a rather shocked expression when I whipped my head around and brought my hand up defensively to stop them. I don’t know why my reaction is considered weird, or even where it stemmed from. I just wish people would respect my personal space.
36, I am an Asian woman. It’s Halloween today and I walked by a white woman dressed as a geisha, with her face painted and hair darkened. We made and held eye contact for a few seconds, and I think she looked embarrassed. It made me feel me angrier somehow. If it was so easy for her to recognize that this was an embarrassing thing to do, why did she still do it?
37, I posted on social media about how an older white man commented on what a shame it was that I don’t speak Spanish (I have a very “Spanish” last name). Then a white guy on social media pointed out that while he was sorry the older man said this to me, he was “taking control of the ridiculous term ‘microaggression’” and that America needs to put on their “big boy pants.”
38, As a young man with an Arab name (Ahmad), I have an eveyday experience with microaggression.For example, whenever I tell my name to new people they would ask where I come from, meaning that I don’t belong here, Many times it was even professors in college or high school who would ask me where I come from in front of all the classroom, to which I would reply “I’m from here”, frustrating them, some of them would even push further and ask “but where were you before moving here ?”.Sometimes I’m asked “why are you so white ??” meaning people with Arab names and heritage are supposed to be all dark-skinned, and I’m asked to justify my skin-color and explain why I don’t match their racial stereotypes.Then, most people assume that I’m Muslim, without me ever mentioning my religion at all (in fact I don’t believe in any), whenever I go to a party and start drinking alcohol there is someone who would say to me “hey Ahmad you aren’t supposed to drink ! your religion prohibits driking !” making everyone look inquiringly at me, expecting an explanation, as if my religious life was their business.
39, From a colleague who heard my accent and asked when I came here. My response - “I’ve lived here since before you were born, buddy.” At a smoke break at work.
40, White pharmacist asks white girl I’m training if she knows a particular old movie. Girl says yes and turns to me and asks if I have seen the movie. Supervisor jumps in before I respond and says “She doesn’t know that movie, she wasn’t born here!”(Referring to America). Apparently, knowledge of certain movies is limited by your place of birth.
41, I’m an Asian American woman who is a hairstylist. When I first started out I was in a high end salon. Countless times I received “compliments” for speaking English so well, sounding so “educated” for a young single mom, for dealing with creepy men who asked me out on dates, and for dealing with rich women (some were Asian immigrants) who talked down to me. I love what I do but it was so disheartening to have a crap shoot of walk-in clients. Those first couple of years were rough but I have a wonderful clientele now.
42, We were celebrating our 2nd wedding anniversary and decided to head out to a small town in Texas where we honeymooned. After a 6 hour drive, my husband, who is Black, and I (Biracial),showed up at our hotel only to be told (sternly) that they did not have a reservation under our name(s). I pulled out the confirmation page print outs and the white guy who was at check-in studied that document like it was fake. 30 minutes later - he comes up saying he accidentally gave our room to someone else(who was somehow checked in under our reservation). We had plans to go see the new Bond movie that night, but we cancelled the plans and for the first time felt so black in a white town. It left a bad taste in our mouth. Made me feel scared.
43, Today, my white co-worker brought her dog to work. When I walked in the office this morning, she mentions how her dog likes to be talked to in Spanish (inferring that I can speak Spanish). I’m Mexican American and can speak Spanish but have not shared this with her (given that we have only been sharing an office for less than a week). She goes on to say that she lived in a “diverse” neighborhood where people spoke Spanish and how her dog must have come from a Spanish speaking home because he gets very excited each time someone speaks Spanish. Needless to say I did not speak Spanish to try and impress her or her dog.
44, It’s the first cold day of winter in Indianapolis, and a hard freeze warning issued. I walk up to a crowded bus stop and see a white lady wearing nothing but a very light sweater-she is probably in her late 70s.She complains its too cold.We get in the bus and I stand next to her. She wails “It’s too cold!” I give her my only winter jacket to keep warm. The white guy next to me asks me if I’m her care taker.
45, “You know, Trump is an idiot,” my colleague began, “but he seems to be the only one who is going to do something about the immigration problem.”  I was surprised that one the best teachers at our 99% Latino school held this opinion.I reminded him of the effect that U.S. policies have had on Mexico and other Nations since the 18th century, asserting that the U.S. has a responsibility to accept immigrants from a world it has ruined.After a pause and a deep inhalation, my colleague ended our conversation saying, "I’ve never thought of it that way.”
46, An interesting observation from our project: Most of the submissions we received from May-Nov 2016 were from angry white people about how non-whites pointed out their racism. (Which we did not post because they are not microaggressions.)
47, Went to a friend’s softball game, and sat at the far end of the bleachers because there was nowhere else to sit. There are two white women there. One had her purse on the bleachers. As I sit down I think to myself watch her grab her purse. Sure enough not ten second later she grabs her purse like I was going to try to steal it.People need to realize some of the worst criminals wear three piece suits, and not some brown skinned guy watching his friend play softball.  Made me feel sad at the ignorance of some people.
48, A coworker of mine constantly comments about her aggravation over having to decipher what these “third world country” call center “people” are saying. While she tries her best to portray an Indian accent. I’ve complained numerous times but stopped when nothing was being done about it  I’m Mexican and even I cry when she says things like this. But she doesn’t realize she’s doing or saying anything wrong. Made me feel disgusted, hurt, angry, vindictive.
49, Opera auditions notice sent to my black arts themed group:
50, I have to make a video for a school project with three other white people about a book. I want to be a certain person, but I can’t, because in the book they’re white and I’m not white, according to my team. They are adamant about keeping everybody looking ‘like they did in the book’, which means that I can’t be in the video because there aren’t any Indian people in it.I end up switching to another group.
51, I was having a heart to heart with a (white) friend and he’d been understanding about other issues so I brought up that I was uncomfortable with the casual frequency that some of our white friends had been using n****r jokingly, hoping he’d talk to them about it without me having to. He agreed that they use it often, but said that I shouldn’t be offended because I ‘wasn’t even black’. I’m mixed race (afro-Caribbean father and white mother), but even if I was white I have a right to be offended by racial slurs and he has no right to tell me ‘how black I am’.
52, Okay, so my class had this huge test coming up. I studied weeks for it. So when I got a 100% I was really happy. The teacher tends to announce everyone’s scores in class. When she said my name and what score I got, I heard someone whisper“She only got that score because she’s Asian.”This wasn’t the first time someone said this.Made me sad and angry that everyone believes I only get good grades because of my race, not based off my hard work.
53, I walk into a party where there is all white people. As soon as I walk in the door, a guy asks what my race is. It was literally the first words spoken to me. When I answered “black”, his girlfriend immediately said “well we say the word nigga here so just letting you know.” Later she even justified herself by saying it was OK because she says it with an “a” on the end instead of “er.”  Made me feel like not going out to parties and less interested in meeting new people.
54, I am a college junior. I lost my student ID today, so I went to the office to replace it. There’s a bit of a line, like 2 other people, so I wait. Both are white men, and both have lost their IDs as well. The women behind the desk help them, whatever, it’s fine. It’s my turn, and I go up and say “Hi, I need to replace my ID.” The woman looks at me and asks, “Are you an employee…?” She didn’t ask the other people that. I look down at my backpack, sketchbook, and laptop that I’m carrying with me, and wonder how that could translate to being an employee. I just reply “No, I’m a student,” get my ID, and walk out of there reminded that being a POC in white spaces must mean that you are serving them. I am black/mixed.
55, Friend, holding a brown-colored stick: “Look, it’s you!” *throws stick over fence*
56, Calling someone out on a racist comment about the colonisation of Australia, and having a man tell me that I’m not invited to contribute to the discussion because I’m not from a post-colonial country. I’m an Indigenous Australian woman, and white-passing.
57, My boss talking about the role of socioeconomic factors in education, “So the star kids would be the kids from stable families, you know, mom and dad, stable homes, good income, and the bad kids were the kids with unstable families, a lot of fighting, alcohol, poor, single-parent households, living in bad neighborhoods. In fact, the star kids’ parents all lived in the same side of town as opposed to the bad kids’ parents. Kinda like my side of town and your side of town, because your side has a history of being very poor and unstable and you know, my side has all those stable families.”
58, I’m sitting in a room waiting for my patient to get an MRI and one of the technicians is talking about how he’s getting billed for an accident from the hospital. He proceeds to complain that while he has to pay while any “Juan Valdez” can come in to the ER and get a full work-up and not pay and the best part is “they” don’t speak English and need a translator.
59, A girl at work straight up told me that colleges didn’t accept white people like herself. She said they only want brown people, like me, and poor people, also like me. She should really tell this to all the colleges that are +50% white. I had no response. I just kind of went deer in the headlights.
60, I’m an Asian American student, and when I’m in class at the beginning of the year, teachers would generally ask me if I understood basic words. Sometimes this happens several times throughout the year when I’ve had the teacher every other day!
61, In high school my white teacher told me, her Asian student, to wake up. I was in the second row, right in front of her, and clearly awake. I could only stare back in silence.
62, I’m shopping for a birthday card for my dad. He’s black. All the cards are for white dads.
63, At a coworker’s baby shower, two friends are eating some spicy food. One says, “If you can eat that you are like a Mexican.” The other turns to me and says, “I can totally take this. Does that make me an honorary Latino?” I could only say no and shake my head. I felt angry, but too embarrassed to make a scene, since I had already been labeled as “fiesty” by people at work. This particular person always likes to emphasize that they can “take” spicy food to me and seems to want me to congratulate them for it.
64, So I’m in a sorority, and we all got invited to a frat party. I was having a pretty good time talking to this white guy I met, and we were having a really good conversation. After a while he tilted his head, squinted, and said,“you know, you speak English REALLY well!”After he said that, I turned around and just walked away. I am half Mexican and half Indian (so, dark skinned) and was born in America. The only language I speak is English….
65, I am in San Francisco standing outside of where I work in SOMA on Mission and 4th trying to get a cab. Not being successful (not the first time in San Francisco), my co worker comes out and offers to assist, instantly a cab stops for us. As soon as the cab driver realizes it is me getting in and not her he says, I am not going to Oakland. I reply, that’s great because I’m going to Pacific Heights. I am mixed (black and white), my coworker is white and blonde and the cab driver is Asian. Funny thing is that my blonde, white coworker lives in Oakland.
66, I, a Black woman with locs, was on a local college campus when a young white female student asked me if I was related to another Black woman with locs who worked there. Since this happens regularly, I said my usual “No” with a non-threatening smile. She then clarified that she thought we were relatives because we “sound” the same. That was a new one! I’m used to all Black people looking the same but I guess all black women with locs who pronounce our words “correctly” must also be from the same family tree.
67, I was taking anatomy and physiology and during an open lab session one of my classmates (who is a white male) asked me what my major was. But before I could tell him he said “Wait you’re doing nursing right? Am I right ??” in a manner where he felt very confident in his answer. When I told him I was taking a class to be a medical lab technician, he sounded astonished and baffled all at the same time. He said that “It’s a shame that you’re not trying to be a nurse.”
68, I overheard one of my husband’s co-workers tell him that“It must be nice to be married to an Asian woman, because they’re so submissive.”
69, I was waiting in the checkout line at a convenient store on the Jersey shore to buy a drink and a snack. Two young white guys who were chatting walked between the checkout line and the counter, clearly heading for the door with food and Gatorade. The cashier called to them “Excuse me, you have to pay for that.” One guy said, “Oh,” and instead of going to the back of the line, he cut in front of me and pays for the food at the counter. The cashier didn’t say anything or send them to the back of line. It happened so quickly, I didn’t respond, but afterward I felt their oblivious entitlement infuriating.
70, While talking to a friend about relationships and my lack of experience with them, she claimed that “You shouldn’t have any problems with finding a boyfriend; you’re Asian and pretty much all white guys love Asian girls.” Obviously, not only is the sole attractive quality I possess my race, but the only type of person I want (or deserve) to have a relationship with is white.
71, I’m waiting to visit my father after his heart surgery with my mother behind a pair of doors. Another South Asian family is waiting some distance away from us to visit someone else. A white nurse opens the door and seeing all of us says, ‘Only two visitors per patient!’
72, I work in a Mexican restaurant. My white male coworker is serving a table when he turns around and asks me: “Hey, you’re Mexican, how do you pronounce this word in Spanish?”I reply: “I’m not Mexican, I’m Paraguayan.”He proceeds to say loudly: “No one cares, it’s the same damn thing.”This was said right in front of our costumers.Not all Latinos are Mexican and Mexicans are not similar to Paraguayans. I felt belittled by the fact that my entire history, people and culture can be dismissed by one ignorant comment.
73, I first moved to England at the age of 6. During one of my first few days in school a boy my age said to me ”why don’t you go back to your own country?” I was obviously shocked and confused and all I could think to do was tell my teacher who told me to respond to him by saying ”Why don’t you go back to YOUR own country?” since the boy happened to be Italian.
74, One day, my brother is trying to have a conversation with me about my weight. In an effort to get me to try and slim down he says:
75, A white man in his 50s/60s (a stranger) stared at me (an Asian American woman in her 20s) as I was leaving the office and said, “That’s a very pretty outfit.” His tone was ambiguously friendly but a little lecherous, I thought.
76, Small talk conversation about our high school between me, someone of Sri Lanken ancestry, and two white people. One of the white people said, “Our high school had to bring in a gifted education program to help get rid of Punjabi gangs”. As they say this, they wriggle their eyebrows at me as if to suggest that I am in association with these Punjabi gangs that supposedly have plagued their high school. I say, “I’m not, Punjabi, I’m Sri Lankan”. The white person then says, “Yeah, well, we had those too.”
77, “Do any of you speak English!?!?” (as the lady cuts to the front of the line) Yelled at me while in line with two other men of color (different shades of brown) at Costco 1-Hour Photo. Made me angry, so I gave it right back to her: “Yes! I speak English! The back of the line is over there!"
78, A  white professor runs up to me from halfway down the hall.“I like your hair,” he says, without introduction. I have enormous curly red-blonde hair that has an obvious African texture.
79, A friend asked me, “Where’d you get that dress from? China?” Guess she forgot that I already told her I’m not from China.
80, My freshman year of college I made a single friend on my floor and for a while she was my only friend. The next year, my floormates were my closest friends and I would go out with them if I ever had extra money (which was very rare).One day, out of nowhere, I got a text from her calling me “fucking bitch”, saying that I was racist because she was white and I only liked Asians, and I would turn her down every time she wanted to go to our favorite restaurant.
81, microaggressions:
82, I’m watching an Improv Everywhere video. One of the (white) actors involved greets a “bystander” in Spanish. (“Que tal?” is the first thing he says, before the bystander speaks.) This has nothing to do with the scenario; it’s just because the bystander is Hispanic. Made me feel annoyed, indignant.
83, I’m a Customer Service Agent for Amazon.com in a foreign site. Many customers ask for an Agent in the United States the moment they hear my voice.
84, I’m a mixed race girl (Nigerian & English) who has just finished transitioning from a relaxer to natural hair. I’m sat with my Caucasian friend and Black friend at lunch talking about having children when the Caucasian girl announces: “well my children will be some sort of mixed race, we’ve already established that. But i don’t want them to have that really curly hair. No. None of that.”I'm angry that she would think it’s acceptable to reject and act disgusted at a feature that her friend has!! Also disappointed as she acts as if she wants her children to have brown skin but no other features associated with being black.
85, When standing next to my mom -“I didn’t know you were adopted.”
86, I walked into my optometrist office to pick-up an order of contact lenses. Unexpectedly the doctor takes me back and asks me to try on a pair of hard lenses to see if I liked them. I thought this was strange since I wear soft lenses. Then she said, “How does that feel Muhammad?” I’m Filipino and White, not Middle Eastern in any sense. We looked at each other awkwardly as I responded, “They feel weird, also my name is Stanley.”
87, I was planning to go to a Halloween/costume party with my four other girl friends, who happen to be all white. (We live in a small Canadian university town… not very diverse, it’s bound to happen.)
88, While in a hotel restroom at a teacher conference, a middle aged lady came up to me and said “HI” in Mandarin, Japanese, and Korean, then asked, “Did I get any of those right? Are you one of those?”
89, Apartment-searching with my brother in LA. The landlord set up an appointment. When my brother arrived 5 minutes early, the landlord was showing around a white couple. When he turned to my brother, he said that he wouldn’t show the apartment and that it now cost $400 more per month. The neighbor later told us that the landlord always does that when he sees black customers. We are both young black men, looking for a place to live.
90, This afternoon at the university bookstore I went up to the register to return a book and chatted with the cashier, an old man. I was very friendly, he asked my major and I told him I was a grad student.
91, Strangers deem it appropriate to touch my hair without asking. It happens often and in any public space. I am a Black girl with waist length locs. Makes me annoyed or angry that my personal space is being violated.
92, I had an English teacher who loved to talk, and whenever she’d say anything about race or black culture, she’d turn to me (the only black kid in the room) as if to validate/confirm the statement.
93, At a comedy club to see my boyfriend perform. A guy goes up and starts making really racist and sexist jokes, and talking about how he has a “black” fetish. After all the comics perform, they’re called up to see who makes it to the next round. In the thirty seconds they should be standing on stage, he runs off the stage, sits next to me, and says, “Hey, sista! How are things in the hood?” I don’t know what to do, but respond politely enough that he gets disappointed that I “act white.” This same man a few months later performed his routine to me and another black girl in a separate comedy skit, beginning his act by saying, “I love black bitches.” Made me feel angry, upset, gross.
94, My friend works at the desk at the front of our dining hall. One time she asked me to sit in her chair for her while she went to the bathroom. I was called her name twice, and both people looked at my face.She is 6 inches taller than me with long hair and a darker complexion. I have glasses and am a boy. We’re both black.
95, I’m an international student in the UK from Asia. At my first tutorial in my first year of university, we get paired up to know a random person better and write a story about them.
96, All my life I had comments about my hair, very often, a simple comparison to the person who’s talking hair. I am black and stopped perming my hair more than 10 years ago. It is a choice, I refuse to torture my hair for a beauty norm I don’t agree with. My hair is very thick, bulky, dense and dry. The worst is from my family, almost every time I see them: “How do you comb your hair? Do you ever comb it? See how the comb can go through my hair? So what are you going to do with your hair? You know what you should do? etc…” They almost touch it every time. One day, a group of cousins even gave me an “intervention.” My white roommate and her boyfriend asked me if my hair ever grows (I have shoulder length hair).
97, I have very thick & curly hair that I straighten when I need a trim. Because it goes past my shoulders, I always get a few people who either shove their hands in my hair or touch my hair (without my permission) while asking me if that’s all mine or a weave….like black people can’t have “nice hair.”
98, I have older half-brothers. Every time they introduce me to any of their friends they seem shocked to see that I’m not as dark as them.“Wow. Are you adopted? You look so different! And you guys are related?”Yup we came out of the same place. Made me annoyed.
99, I’m a Dominican female that people confuse as a “white American” woman. At job interviews, I tell them where I’m from, born and raised in the Dominican Republic, they say “Oooh” with a tone of disappointment. Makes me feel like I was better when I was considered a “white american” woman. At interviews for employment. Makes me angry and frustrated.
100, Here I am, sitting in my cubicle, silently typing to myself. I have this really loud co-worker, with whom I have spoken frequently. We even take classes together (we’re both in Graduate school). He stops right in front of my computer and announces, or rather asks, “So what are you bi-racial or something?“
101, Back in High School, my English teacher asked us to choose a Jane Austen book to write a report on. A new bookstore had just opened up near my house so I went in to buy one. I approached an assistant and asked him where I could find Pride and Prejudice to which he replied, “Oh, I don’t know. I think that may be in the ‘black interest’ section.” I was livid.
102, I was standing in the cafeteria of a major academic medical center wearing shirt, tie, and the same white coat that all my medical school classmates wear (with stethoscope). An older white lady tapped me on the shoulder and asked “Excuse me do you work here? I’m trying to find the soups…” and even once I fully turned around it never occurred to her that I am medical student, not a cook.I am a black male medical student in a major Northeast academic medical center.
103, A coworker sent me a music video to to indicate how cool and knowledgeable he is about music and culture. He’s back after several years working independently, so he’s trying to familiarize himself with the many new people (including myself) now working here. He thought it would appeal to me because the video is filmed in India. While part of the larger Indian diaspora, I’m not Indian. I’ve explained this. Before he sent me this video, I’ve explicitly said I don’t identify as Indian, so he’s just being willfully ignorant. Made me feel awkward and angry.
104, In the UK primary school (4-11 year olds) I went to, there were only two little Black girls. One of them came to me crying at playtime one day, saying the other kids wouldn’t play with her because she was brown. The other girl I found crying in the toilets once because another child had called her the n-word.This was just a few years ago.
105, While watching Oprah on TV being interviewed, my mom (who has short permed hair) says, “Oprah looks good with big natural hair because she has a larger build.” She knows I am currently growing out my short natural hair, and have worn a variety natural styles in the past. I didn’t know I needed to be a certain size to look good with a particular natural hair style. Made me feel angry, sad, disturbed, disappointed.
106, We were talking about the cross-race effect in my eyewitness class (the cross-race effect is the finding that it’s difficult for people to accurately identify members of another race, compared to same-race identifications). Someone asked about whether, if we standardized skin tone, if we would still see the cross-race effect. The professor then talked about bleaching pictures of faces to standardize skin tones. Why should white be the default?
107, I was walking through a large city late at night with a group of people, one of whom was a white girl I had just met. Every time we walked past a Black person, she had a disparaging comment to make. The Black women were all hookers, the Black men were all drug users, the sleeping homeless people were disgusting, etc. I was the only Black person in the group and felt like she was also judging me.
108, I’m laying down on the couch next to my mom. I am a light skinned Puerto Rican and my mom is tan. Her friend (Puerto Rican) just had a baby with a black man and she send my mom a picture of her new baby. Among seeing the picture, my mom smiles and responds to the text “she’s beautiful, thank god she didn’t come out black lmaoo.”
109, One of my (white) classmates told me that the reason my (black) thesis advisor loved my project about mixed-race representation in visual culture was because my advisor was “obsessed with black people.”
110, English is not my first language, but according to my ESL teachers I am ready to take university course; thus, I am taking one university class. During class, the professor alwas remarks how he does not expect much from me because English is not my native tongue. I know I do not speak perfect English, but I am very motivated and he just puts me down with his: “Oh, awesome you know this word” (a very basic one)It makes me feel I will never be good enough in the U.S
111, I’m in a shop, looking at some foundation with a friend. The options we find are ‘ivory’, 'beige’ and, bizarrely, 'natural’. None of them match our skin tones.
112, Last week, my friend and I were downtown waiting at a crosswalk when she accidentally bumped into an older white male. My friend goes, “excuse me” to which the man replied, “Oh that’s alright, honey, as long as you don’t try to pickpocket me.” We were both confused at his statement, and I didn’t want her to brush it off as nothing. I think microaggressions sugarcoated with humor, such as this, towards black POC are noticeably offensive and not funny at all.
113, An opening for a manager position comes up at my job (an organization that works with primarily refugee students). I talk to my director about it, since I’ve been with the group for quite a while and they have been explicit in how much they like my work. He knows that I am mixed, though most people read me as white. He tells me they’re looking for a minority. I remind him that I am. He says “a VISIBLE” minority.
114, When my White friend says that she wants to be Black. When she says, “ Gurl, I am not White”.  When she says that she wants to be “light-skinned”. When she says she wants a big ass. When she says White people can’t dance.
115, A teacher said that people should try to neutralize their accents so that they would be taken seriously when talking in public. My boyfriend actually agreed. It is not ok to try to erase part of someone’s identity because they feel is inconvienient for them to fully understand their comments. It is not ok to try to erase cultural diversity.
116, I’m talking with a coworker about plans to spend time in a mostly-Black neighborhood after dark. With a sideways glance, and a knowing laugh, she asks,“Do you have any Black friends you can take with you?”
117, Today at the elementary school I work at:A kid on the phone w/ a parent, was speaking a different language, is asked by a (white male) staff “Are you talking to someone or just making noises?” and proceeds to laugh and looks over at me and the person sitting next to me, as if he wanted us to laugh along with him. So I look him dead in the face like -____- (with no laughter) and turned to the person sitting next to me and said loud and clear “do you know what Microaggression is!?”
118, While working as a tutor at a charter high school that is predominantly African American, a young boy asks me (a Black female) if I could give him information about becoming a doctor. He knows I am slated to go to medical school early the next year and has always wanted to become a surgeon. I’m delighted and give him lots of information. The next day I am told to go to the office.
119, I work as a teacher on a Native reserve. Students are behind because of social reasons – lack of motivation, their parents are into drugs, drinking, are fighting, etc. I see this as a consequence of a history of white oppressors forcing the Natives onto reserves, and enacting cultural genocide. Most of the teachers are white, and one of my coworkers (white) is racist, but seems to be oblivious to that fact. This is very dangerous. He makes comments like “the school would be a lot better if the principal weren’t Native”, and “These kids are so stupid, it must be their genes”. And, without fail, every time I (Chinese) interact with him he subtly makes “chinky” eyes by pulling on the side of his eye.
120, Once when I was 8, I had a substitute teacher in a class that I didn’t enjoy very much.I was zoned out while she was instructing us, and when she set us free to work on our project and I didn’t know what to do, she approached me and said, very slowly and enunciated, “Do you speak English?”I am a Korean American. I didn’t know how to react!
121, When I go to the doctor about an STD that’s bothering me, he said “ah, of course.” When I asked him what he meant he said that roughly 1 in 2 African American females have herpes according to the CDC. which is what I was there for. Made me upset.
122, During a meeting I had set up with my middle-aged white female English Composition professor to discuss some issues I had with her essay prompts (vague or conflicting directions, mostly), she cut me off and said, “Well, you know, the University education ISN’T for everyone. You might want to consider your alternatives, like trade school or the military.” When I asked her what she meant, she replied, “If THIS class is too difficult for you, then you’re DEFINITELY not going to be able pass any of your other courses, which will also be in English.”
123, When my family moved from Nigeria to America, the elementary school I was to attend forcibly held me back to repeat a grade despite my outstanding test scores. Also, one my first day of school my fourth grade teacher asked a class mate to show me the way to the library, and to specifically show me the picture book section.
124, I’m Dominican-American and one day me and my friend who’s Bengali went to the mall. We walked into a MAC store and a White lady approached us and asked us “Where are you guys from? You guys look exotic.” Me and my friend were not sure what she meant by that statement but I was really confused. I thought about the term “exotic” and i thought to myself, “Am I some kind of weird looking creature?” I’m not sure why people describe foreigners or non-white people as “exotic.” I personally find it quite disturbing.
125, Some girl asked me today if I played sports? I just said No because I didn’t feel like talking. After she replied, “But your tall, big and black, doesn’t every big black person at this school play some type of sport”
126, Today I heard this dude go up to this Chinese kid and say you must be in Calculus cause your Chinese. All Chinese people are good with numbers aren’t they?
127, I was in Manhattan around 47th street standing at the corner waiting for a taxi, the taxi pulls up and he says “I am not going to Brooklyn, Sorry”. I proceed and get into the taxi and promptly tell him am going just to Park Avenue and ask him why he thinks am going to Brooklyn and why he is making assumptions. He basically stummers through some kind of explanation trying to blame it on the traffic, it was 11p.m) and he proceeds to try and apologize. He was from Pakistan too!!!!
128, Today I was doing some volunteering at a little Red Cross shop in Sydney, Australia. I’m born and raised in Australia. I have Persian heritage and have an olive complexion. A lady was looking around and saw some little Thai dancing statues. She looked over at me and said “Are these from your homeland? India?” I am shy and became easily lost for words and she assumed I couldn’t speak English. The manager told her quickly that I am Australian. She was trying to be friendly but she seemed pretty clueless. It’s as if she’d never seen a non-white person before.
129, It’s dark. I’m walking home alone. A white guy comes towards me. We near each other and I tense, but I square my shoulders and stand tall. Just as I think I’ll be ignored, he jerks his head towards me and yells, “Nihao! Aiyaiyaiyai!” I jump. Part of me wants to yell back but fear takes over and I don’t (I never do). I AM Chinese, and English is my first language. My command of English is good enough for the courts of England and Wales. Yet, every other day someone goes out of their way to fling nonsensical words in a variety of languages I don’t even speak, in my direction.
130, I received my voter registration card in the mail and realized that under race it said “Hispanic” instead of “Asian”. I checked my drivers license and there is nothing regarding my race. Clearly, the state of South Carolina decided to label me by my last name and picture.
131, Was just told that it was awesome seeing “someone like you” singing along to my brother Jeff karaokeing Springsteen’s “Born to Run.” Thanks for reminding me how much I have to let slide on a daily basis.
132, Got interim back today and a couple white students looked and saw that I have a higher grade than them and proceed to tell me I’m not really black because I make good grades.
133, At the Grand Ole Opry hotel in Nashville TN, facilitating a conference. While navigating this huge and confusing hotel, I stopped to read the signs, probably with a dumbfounded look on my face. Two elderly, silver-haired, and very polite white women asked me (49 y/o, black man, Mississippi born and raised, PhD student), “Can you read?” I responded, “Yes, ma'am, very well.” When these things happen, I always have a better response… once the moment is gone.
134, I am on a date with a White guy, and it’s my very first date, ever. I’m nervous because I think he’s gorgeous. He tells me that I’m pretty for a Black girl. ) :
135, I was at work and the topic of racism came up with my boss who is Italian and he was being very honest and open about his use of the ‘N word’ ‘back in the day’ and how even now he will toss it around. I am mixed but very fair skinned. We ended up all sharing our stance on the issue, myself and my other white co-workers. A very dark skinned man walked in and as soon as he did everyone looked at each other and grinned and said ‘well i guess we better move on to a different topic’ it was almost as if me looking white made it okay to be honest about their ignorance.
136, I was walking through my neighborhood to get to a neighbor’s house. The houses in my neighborhood are cookie cutter model homes, and the majority of people who live in the development are white. I’m not.
137, When the co-editor of my school newspaper couldn’t get all the cultural clubs to fit in on a page dedicated to celebrating all the cultures at my school, the co-editor says, “Well, if all the cultural clubs don’t fit, we can just take out the Asian ones. They’re all the same anyways."
138, One of my best friends recently told me, “The first time I met you I didn’t know if we could be friends. I mean, you were really smart and I thought you’d be one of those obnoxious Indians talking about your GPA all the time, I’m glad I realized that you’re different and waaay more chill than the rest of them.” Then she expected me to thank her for this “compliment”.
139, In my a cappella group’s rehearsal today, I pointed out how we sing a lot of pop songs that were originally sung by white people while trying to make a point about not singing an Imagine Dragons song when we already sing a Mumford and Sons song and a Maroon 5 song, which are both similar in style to the Imagine Dragons one. At least two (white) people responded angrily to me/acted very offended that I had the nerve to point out that we sing mostly white music.
140, When I was a freshman in college, I was placed in a living-and learning program. Out of 100 or so freshman that year I was one of 4 black males. One of them (my friend) and I are of similar height  and build, but have differing skin tones and facial features. We all had to take classes together over the next two years and every single professor consistently called both of us by the other’s name. When it would happen white classmates would comment on how we “did look alike.”
141, A conversation between a friend and I divulging into a condescending intro calculus lecture at me, ignoring my multiple reminders that I have a degree in mathematics. Couldn’t help but connect his aggressive “tutoring” to my inability to find a job after graduation - or interview, or even a returned phone call. Evidently we Arabs are just too backwards for math and science, regardless of educational background.
142, Sitting around the circle at a teen feminist, riot grrrl meeting, someone said they named their duck “Jose the Mexican duck”. They said “we gave him a Mexican mustache so we call him Jose.” They found it really funny.
143, A coworker believes erratic behavior in a white person means they’re mentally ill or “crazy.” Erratic behavior in a black person, he assumes they’re a “crackhead."
144, I’m having lunch with a friend of mine and a stranger. My friend mentions that he loves to gossip, and the conversation between them transitions into how its relieving to say mean things about people sometimes. Eventually, the stranger says, with a giggle, “I really like to make racist jokes.”While I, an Indian person, am sitting right next to her.
145, Being in a small, majority white southern town, trinadad’s song “all gold everything” comes on" at the dance club. And every white person happily singing the chorus in the presence of other minorities, including me, a black female. Made me uncomfortable.
146, I was telling my coworker (who is a white woman) about the music video Asian Girlz by Day Above Ground and why it was offensive to me, and she did was laugh and say, “Blame Asian porn! It’s because of that people think you people do those sorts of things!”
147, During my trip to California this summer, I visited the California State Railroad Museum in Sacramento with my girlfriend and her family. While wandering on my own, I passed by a tour group looking at a corner distinctly different from the rest of the museum–a small section dedicated to the contributions made by Chinese Americans in railroad history. The tour guide, an elderly white male, goes on to say, “We had to teach the Chinese how to build things, because their hands are not used to building things. They’ve never built anything before. (pause) Except for the Great Wall of China.” And then he proceeded to chuckle.
148, I commented off-hand to a white classmate about colonialism, to which he replied “What was so bad about colonialism?” I tried to explain the obvious, and his reponse: “Oh, well I guess it was bad for you… not so bad for us…” I was furious.
149, I am Latina and I come from a low income family. Because I have excelled academically, I am applying to several Ivy League institutions.
150, You and I are both women. That night, we are strangers standing at the bus stop. A man arrives soon after we do, and tries to make conversation with us. He’s insistent. He’s pushy. He looks threatening. I’m scared and I see that you’re scared too. We try to rebuff him. When the bus arrives, he also hops on. You and I sit together because the bus is almost empty. He follows us to our seats. He continues to try to get us to talk. Personal details. Are you students? Where do you live? When he leaves after 40 minutes, you and I are so relieved that we start laughing. You’ve been glancing at your cell phone like me. You’ve been worried that he wants to take the same train too.Later, we get on the train but we continue talking. We talk for over two hours. About our problems and our plans. Our earlier experience makes us open up. Just a little before the train arrives at its destination, you bring up your girlfriend. You look at me, in that moment, with a wary, fearful look. And you wait for my reaction. I realize I’m familiar with that look. I’m a queer woman of color too. I look the same way when I bring my girlfriend up to another person for the first time: distrustful, fearful, waiting for rejection.
151, Some time last year, I (Hispanic female) was at the mall with a few of my friends, and my one friend’s mom (white) had driven us. We’re all eating in the food court and we see a little Asian girl, sitting with her mother, and wearing crocs. My friends and I proceed to talk about how little kids are the only ones who can get away with looking cute in crocs (just joking around, you know), and then we realise that maybe the little girl’s mom has noticed us looking at her daughter and that she might be creeped out or whatever. We’ve since looked away, still chuckling, when all of a sudden my friend’s mom says this: “No, she probably looks so focused because she’s doing trigonometry, calculus, and algebra in her head all at the same time, cause that’s how *their* brains work”.
152, My mother works at a daycare center, and her white female coworker refused to let a child hang up on the wall a picture of Barack Obama that he had drawn (the children were told to draw a picture of someone that they admired). When questioned as to why, the woman’s excuse was that it would be inappropriate because the child had used a brown crayon to color in Obama’s skin.
153, Does this count? I live in Latin America, and I study English. A classmate told me that when working on a call center answering calls from the US someone accused her of being an illegal immigrant.
154, While standing in line at a grocery store, a child no more than 2 points at me and says, “Mama, monkey”. The mother proceeds to tell her son that it is not nice to call black people monkeys…to their face, and she is saying this in Spanish…then in English she tells her son to say sorry. Before he could open his little mouth, I look at the mother and tell her: kids do not understand that it’s only okay to racist at home…I tell her this in Spanish, and she picked up her kid and left the line.
155, As a Hispanic non-cis sex worker I picked up a John who proceeded to tell me that this was all “faggots and tannies” were good for, being the receptacle of his sperm and that we should be grateful for it. I then had to have sex with him to pay rent… Made me sad, scared, angry.
156, My upper middle class white friend is back from studying abroad in London, where I also studied for a semester before her. We like to bond pretentiously as a joke to our US-bound friends. She brings up the East End by describing it as “run-down” and “trashy”, prefaces her offensive comment by saying, “This is going to sound bad, but…” and says, “there are a ton of Indian and Middle Eastern people living there now.” She describes people in burqas as “strange,” saying that it blows her mind that this is considered regular attire in certain parts of the world. I am Indian American.
157, My colleague at work constantly refers to our two Taiwanese-born coworkers as the"Asian Import/Export Business". He calls them Peking and Duck.
158, I’m taking a Red Cross Water Safety Instructor class. It’s the last day of class and the instructors feel pressed for time to test our skills and for us to take a written test. We climb out of the pool and I ask how much time we have to change. They say ten minutes and I frown, because I have long braids in and I need to wash the chlorine out my hair and off my body. The first instructor says, “You don’t need to look pretty!” His superior laughs, “Yeah! You don’t need to look pretty, we’re just taking a test.” Thanks, bros. Because obviously the only reason a woman needs more time to change is to look pretty.My response, “I’m not interested in looking pretty for you. Your heads got inflated hanging out on the deck. I just need to wash my braids out.”
159, In downtown Detroit, a brown skinned South Asian woman approaches me and asks “where is the bleaching cream?” I don’t understand what she’s asking, so she rephrases it: “where is the skin lightening cream?” One, I am not an employee of CVS. Two, I have nice even brown skin (black American) and have never so much as looked at skin bleaching cream in my life. I tell her I have no idea, and she walks off in a huff. She didn’t have any noticeable blemishes that would need lightening, either.
160, I teach an Advanced English class at a prominent secondary school full of bright, kind, and enthusiastic kids. We’re currently reading Romeo and Juliet, and I thought it would be really great to show scenes performed with modern actors/settings/dress. When Romeo came onscreen, his beautiful recitation could not be heard over the squeals, guffaws, and indignation…he was black (as am I, though apparently ambiguously so in their eyes). I was horrified, angry, rendered speechless - though not for long - but most of all, hurt. Made my eyeballs sweat so hard.
161, For Cinco de Mayo, my dance teacher in high school teaches us some flamenco moves to a Shakira song.
162, I work at a public school a high student of color population mainly Latino. Recently the school got Google Chrome books in three computer labs to replace computers that were at least 9 years old. At the meeting to train teachers on how to operate these new Google Chrome books and thus teach the students how to operate them, most teachers were disinterested.
163, The media is so socially irresponsible that it’s disgusting. “Sleeping with the enemy”? Subtle. An “all-American” girl? What does that even mean? What does “American” mean anymore? Clearly it means “white."
164, I’m a Black woman in my early 40s, and I have a White woman friend from my college days. We’ve been friends for 23 yrs, and we’ve mostly kept in touch via telephone due to living several hundred miles apart. A month ago, she and her two White children, an eight y.o. boy and a 5 y.o. girl, came to visit me for two days, including an overnight stay. About five minutes after their arrival, my friend said,“(Little girl’s name), maybe (my name) can cornrow your hair for you! (Little girl’s name) has been wanting to have that hairstyle!”
165, At a good friend’s birthday party, her boyfriend says he doesn’t identify as white because he’s Jewish. I have the darkest skin the room and my family is black Jews. As a black woman, I don’t have the luxury of not identifying as white or advantage of ever being perceived as white.
166, My English teacher was emphasizing how the bombers were Muslims. Me and another Middle Eastern student tried talking about the bombing perpetuated by the U.S. and we were told to stop talking and people were rolling their eyes at us.
167, I feel like the only queer characters I see in media are rich, attractive, young, white males. Do I not count? Makes me feel unlovable.
168, I’m walking home from a friend’s house with my partner in downtown Toronto on a Friday night when we pass by some white kids waiting outside a club. The guy calls out to us asking if we have a lighter, and before we respond he says,“What, you don’t speak English?”with a smirk on his face.
169, I was tabling for a first-year orientation information booth at my university along with many others, all POC (people of color), mostly East or South Asian. We would always try to greet first years and their parents so we could engage them in conversation and give them free stuff. We tried to catch the attention of a boy and his mother, both white, but his mother shook her head at first and tried to keep walking. When we tried again, she said “oh no, he’sCanadian.”
170, I’m at a fashion show meeting, excited to work with the new designers. Afterwards, I’m pulled aside by my assigned designer & his models needed to have a more professional look. That my “hair” wasn’t doing it for him and he needed something “easier to work with”.
171, “You look just like that girl from The Walking Dead, Michonne.” Said by the graduate student administrative assistant to me, a black PhD candidate (who looks nothing like the actress who plays Michonne). I felt like, even though I had had numerous interactions with this woman, she had never bothered to take the time to figure out what I *actually* looked like, and that I was interchangeable with any other black person.
172, I go out with a white friend. White staff & servers make most eye contact with her, even when they are talking to me.
173, When people lower their voices when they say “black,” like it’s offensive.
174, The same white guy who devoted an entire class presentation to discrimination against people with tattoos told me, a woman of color, that there was no discrimination today against people of color and women and said that affirmative action was reverse discrimination against him.
175, WHEN “UNINTENTIONAL RACISM” ISN’T COUNTED AS RACISM.
176, I am chatting on Facebook with a romantic interest. I am an Asian American gay male, 22. He is a white American gay male, 23. Everything is going fine until he says that he prefers dating Asian men because he doesn’t like “manly” men. While I don’t identify as “manly,” I feel angry and hurt that he felt it was okay to casually generalize about and define a whole group of people for them. Later, he repeatedly refers to an ex as his “Chinese boyfriend,” rather than by any other feature or by the person’s name. I am of Chinese descent; his language makes me feel interchangeable, collectible, fetishized.
177, In a joking tone, one of my room mates remarked to me that when we first moved in he yelled at our other room mate to clean up his pubic hair. My other room mate then pointed out it was my naturally curly head hair. I am a black female living with two white males.
178, When deciding Halloween costumes, me and my friends wanted to do a Disney princess theme for our whole group.  I wanted to be Ariel, but was quickly shut down by all my friends.  They did, however, offer to let me be either Jasmine, Mulan, or Pocahontas, because “it doesn’t make sense for an asian to dress up as a white girl.”
179, A friend was telling us about her lost dog, when another friend turned to me and said, “You didn’t eat it, right?”  I am Chinese-Vietnamese American.
180, True life stories from my day working drive-thru:
181, I was living in a small white town and I was the only person of color in my class, and one of my peers said “Racism doesn’t exist.”
182, My fifth grade teacher told me that the beads in my hair would annoy him. He told me not to move my head too much. On that same day, my gym teacher teased me in front of my entire grade. Everyone laughed when I did jumping jacks. I was the only black girl in the fifth grade in my public elementary school.
183, In my college days, a friend of mine is, like me, black and (cis)male. He is, however, six foot six, and very dark-skinned (I’m part Cherokee and lighter), while I am five foot five. He’s Nigerian, with a traditionally Nigerian name. My name is very different. We’re the same age. A white woman classmate who I figured knew us well still asked us, repeatedly, if we were brothers. And there’s only one reason why she would have assumed that. Sigh. Made me feel as if everything about me would be overlooked in favor of my color.
184, I’m at the bus stop with my folding bicycle.  I’m Asian.  A young guy asks me, “Did you bring that bicycle from your country?”  I respond with, “No, man, I got it off of Craigslist here in Austin.”  He says, “Oh, I didn’t mean any–” and I interrupt, “It’s okay.”  <sigh>
185, I told my white woman classmate that I had been street harassed on the way to school.  She said, “Ugh, I hate when Latino guys harass me! They’re so misogynistic, and Spanish makes those comments sound even slimier!”  I told her that the harasser was actually a white Wall Street-type, and she said, “Oh, that’s not so bad then.  I wouldn’t mind being harassed too much if the guy was attractive and wealthy.”
186, My office says my name, Rachel, on the door. I am the only one who sits in it. People constantly walk in, see me, and say “Oh, I’m sorry… I’m looking for Rachel.”
187, Every time I wear my curly/wavy hair pulled back in a bun, braid, or knot, my coworkers tell me how it makes me look so much more “professional” or “mature."
188, I am Chinese American and lived abroad in China for about six years. On two separate occasions, two different guys told me that I am not a real Chinese–particularly because I was studying Mandarin (I grew up speaking Cantonese).
189, If I hear one more time “you look just like J.Lo!” when in fact I’m dark skinned with jet black hair I’m gonna lose my mind!
190, During college I’m working at a restaurant as a hostess. One of the servers consistently asks me to “keep her station clean”–meaning not to seat any Black guests there–because “they don’t tip.”
191, The woman goes down the line of soon-to-be high school grads she isn’t familiar with, asking them “So, where are you going to college?”.
192, I am Caribbean-American with natural hair ( I don’t chemically straighten it). An older Caucasian woman sitting in the booth next to me at the hair salon tonight said my hair was “fascinating.”
193, When I was 14, I was rushed to the hospital with intense abdominal pains. I was placed in a wheelchair and whisked away from my parents by a young white nurse to get a CAT scan. She wheeled into an empty hallway and then stopped, put the brakes down, and stood in from of me with her hands on the armrests. Inches away from my face she said, “Listen, I know you’re pregnant. You better admit it now or your baby will die on that cat-scan table!” Since I was already crying from the pain, I just nodded ‘no’. She rolled her eyes and then dropped me off in the room. I ended up having a ruptured ovarian cyst. It was years before I even had my first kiss.
194, My geology professor was giving a lecture on national parks, and decided to explain how much they’ve changed since the 1940s.  She did so by saying:  "My grandfather even got a picture with ‘real’ Native Americans. Not just people dressed up for some freak show for tourists.“
195, A “dress for success” bulletin board in my dorm suggests clothing for a professional appearance. Pantyhose are listed for women, specified as being “Natural, beige or tan.” Implying only beige or tan are “natural” skin colors for women.
196, I went out to eat with my family tonight and at some point my dad started to repeat his requests to the waitress in his very limited, contorted version of Spanish, presumably only because her skin was dark.
197, My camp director let us know that 2 Mexican girls were arriving tomorrow. He said, “the Mexicans are coming.” Everyone laughed nervously. The next day he had to explain why calling Mexican people ‘Mexican’ wasn’t offensive.
198, When I walk into a hair store, and the cashier comments on my naturally curly hair; then points me to the flat irons. Also throughout my whole visit asked if I needed heat protectors, but not once ask if I would like curl moisturizer or curl boosters. Made me feel highly upset.
199, A white girl says that she wouldn’t like to live in a predominantly black area because she owns a “swag” sweatshirt and fears she would be attacked for this. But she assures everyone that she’s not racist. Made me feel embarrassed, angry at her for saying it and myself for not calling her out.
200, Whenever we meet in public and wherever she’s got a captive audience, a casual acquaintance trots out the same story, again and again, in mightily triumphant tones: how a clever Afrikaner (South African, white) friend “fooled” the “system” by successfully applying for a STEM scholarship for black American undergraduates and transfer students. Because of the slightly imprecise language in the application (restricting the pool of potential candidates to ‘African-Americans’), this friend received his scholarship. The acquaintance then notes that the scholarship board promptly changed that language the next year to better reflect their aims (helping a disproportionately underrepresented minority enter a white-dominated field). She reports this quite ironically, like the board are being spoilsports, and is usually just a breath away from wondering where the White Person scholarships are. I am astounded by how much delight reporting this anecdote brings her. She honestly believes the outcome was not only just, but that it struck a mighty blow to PC do-gooders.
201, When I was a freshman in college, I was placed in a living-and learning program. Out of 100 or so freshman that year I was one of 4 black males. One of them (my friend) and I are of similar height  and build, but have differing skin tones and facial features. We all had to take classes together over the next two years and every single professor consistently called both of us by the other’s name. When it would happen white classmates would comment on how we “did look alike.” When I asked them to explain they could only name the aforementioned height and build similarities. When I pointed out that this was racist I was told I was overreacting. So what is my face even for? Does my identity even matter if I’m gonna be generalized by the people handing out grades. Good thing we’re both smart I guess…don’t mind being confused for a smart guy.
202, A friend says that a pretty girl who cosplays combines his two favorite “things”: red hair…and Asians.  I don’t know what is worse; that he values women by how close they fit some objectified version of what an Asian woman is, or that he thinks being Asian is a “thing” like dying one’s hair red, and that both are there for his physical enjoyment.  Women of color are not some freaking category for porn.    Why can’t men just talk about us like we’re PEOPLE? I’m a mixed-race girl talking to white, straight, male friend.
203, My white (ex)boyfriend wanted me to roleplay as a slave and he would be the “Plantation Owner.” When I made it clear I wasn’t doing that, he became angry and said, “Your social justice shit is ruining our sex life!"
204, I came into work to pick up my paycheck, and hear my manager grumbling about a couple as they’re leaving the cash.
205, When people ask me what my heritage is, I tell them Mexican and Irish (my parents were both born in the US), and people always say, “That’s such a weird combination!” I know that they mean it in a cultural sense and not a racial one, but it’s still is a little confusing/upsetting.
206, In 2009 I attended an event where people could test drive a car that had yet to debut on the market. I dressed up nicely (wore my favorite skirt!) and made sure I had flats on so it was easier to press the clutch because I wanted to test drive the manual version. When it came my turn to pick a car, I specifically asked for a manual transmission. “A stick?” the guy asked. “Yes,” I replied, and we signed the release and climbed in. “You’re sure?” he asked. I nodded my head. He asked one more time, “You sure you can drive a stick?”  I’m a 27-year-old mixed-ethnicity (Asian/write) female and this was in a college town. I was sure it was more about my gender than my ethnicity. The guy eventually saw that I could indeed drive a stick. But it has bothered me ever since.
207, I am studying to become a teacher. I am black and I have natural  hair. One of my colleagues found it necessary  to pull me aside and inform me that “my current hair situation” just was not professional enough for me to go out to schools on teaching practice and she was surprised my lecturer hadn’t spoken to me about it. She reccommended that I “invest” in whatever the other black girls used  because “I was smart enough to take steps to better myself and I’m too pretty for that anyway.” Made me confused, angry.
208, I had to cover my nose with a fan during cosplay so people will actually take pictures otherwise I’d look “too persian” Fuck you guys, I make a cute ass persian enma ai
209, My professor told our class that over ninety percent of Africa was illiterate.
210, In a casual group setting, I get into a 25-minute argument with a championship debater about why it’s inappropriate and dehumanizing to say the ‘n-word’ in reference, even when there are no Black/African American people present. I’m the only POC (person of color) in the room, and no one can understand why I’m being so 'sensitive.' Made me feel ignored and unintelligent. Made me worry that the only way white people will listen to me is if I can intellectualize and formalize an argument about the basic rights of POC.
211, When I go to the doctor about an STD that’s bothering me, he said “ah, of course.” When I asked him what he meant he said that roughly 1 in 2 african american females have herpes according to the CDC. which is what I was there for. I felt so upset.
212, My friend was frustrated that she couldn’t  but anything under “disadvantages” on her application, so she says, “Sometimes I wish I was half black and half latino, then I’d get into everything.”
213, I logged into Facebook and saw the memes sprawling all over my feed equating the Boston bombings to terrorists, Muslims, and immigrants. I messaged them and engaged in dialogue validating their frustration but expressing how offended I felt and how perpetuating Islamaphobia only results in more violence, especially towards people who look “Middle Eastern”. One person took it down and apologized… another talked with me for a while and ended by saying “don’t get so offended.”
214, I’m from Ocala, FL and living in Boston. I just called my local newspaper in Florida to ask how they were being sensitive to anti-Islamic sentiment in their reporting of the Boston Incident… they accused me of being racist against southern Christians.
215, Upon having seen coverage of the Boston Marathon bombing, my mother, who is white, states, “Middle Easterns… always killing everybody.” I’m Middle Eastern, early 20s, and her son. My little sisters, who are South Asian were also in the same room, and they heard that. I felt very angry, unsafe, disappointed.
216, Today one of my roomates bought supplies for the apartment, and texted everyone except for me (I’m the only black person living here) to ask them to chip in money for it. She then asked my best friend and other roomate, in regards to me: “do you think it will be hard to get the money out of her?” It wasn’t going to be, but now it sure as hell will be. Like because I’m black I’m automatically supposed to be poor/cheap.
217, While working as a tutor at a charter high school that is predominantly African American, a young boy asks me (a Black woman) if I could give him information about becoming a doctor. He knows I am slated to go to medical school early the next year and has always wanted to become a surgeon. I’m delighted and give him lots of information. The next day I am told to go to the office.
218, On Friday evening, after the second suspect in the Boston marathon bombings had been caught, President Obama took to a podium, and said the following:
219, I work as a teacher on a Native reserve. Students are behind because of social reasons – lack of motivation, their parents are into drugs, drinking, are fighting, etc. I see this as a consequence of a history of white oppressors forcing the Natives onto reserves, and enacting cultural genocide. Most of the teachers are white, and one of my coworkers (white) is racist, but seems to be oblivious to that fact. This is very dangerous. He makes comments like “the school would be a lot better if the principal weren’t Native”, and “These kids are so stupid, it must be their genes”. And, without fail, every time I (Chinese) interact with him he subtly makes “chinky” eyes by pulling on the side of his eye.
220, During a meeting I had set up with my middle-aged white female English Composition professor to discuss some issues I had with her essay prompts (vague or conflicting directions, mostly), she cut me off and said, “Well, you know, the University education ISN’T for everyone. You might want to consider your alternatives, like trade school or the military.” When I asked her what she meant, she replied, “If THIS class is too difficult for you, then you’re DEFINITELY not going to be able pass any of your other courses, which will also be in English.”
221, When my family moved from Nigeria to America, the elementary school I was to attend forcibly held me back to repeat a grade despite my outstanding test scores. Also, one my first day of school my fourth grade teacher asked a class mate to show me the way to the library and to specifically show me the picture book section.
222, One day my friend (Bengali) and I (Dominican American) went to the mall. We walked into a MAC store and a white lady approached us and asked us “Where are you guys from?” “You guys look exotic.” Me and my friend were not sure what she meant by that statement, but I was really confused. I thought about the term “exotic” and I thought to myself, “Am I some kind of weird looking creature?” I’m not sure why people describe foreigners or non-white people as “exotic.” I personally find it quite disturbing.
223, Some girl asked me today if I played sports? I just said No because I didn’t feel like talking. After she replied, “But your tall, big and black, doesn’t every big black person at this school play some type of sport”
224, Today I heard this dude go up to this Chinese kid and say you must be in Calculus cause your Chinese. All Chinese people are good with numbers aren’t they?
225, Got interim back today and a couple white students looked and saw that I have a higher grade than them and proceed to tell me I’m not really black because I make good grades
226, I was in Manhattan around 47th street standing at the corner waiting for a taxi, the taxi pulls up and he says “I am not going to Brooklyn, Sorry”. I proceed and get into the taxi and promptly tell him am going just to Park Avenue and ask him why he thinks am going to Brooklyn and why he is making assumptions. He basically stammers through some kind of explanation trying to blame it on the traffic, it was 11p.m) and he proceeds to try and apologize. He was from Pakistan too.
227, Today I was doing some volunteering at a little Red Cross shop in Sydney, Australia. I’m born and raised in Australia. I have Persian heritage and have an olive complexion. A lady was looking around and saw some little Thai dancing statues. She looked over at me and said “Are these from your homeland? India?” I am shy and became easily lost for words and she assumed I couldn’t speak English. The manager told her quickly that I am Australian. She was trying to be friendly but she seemed pretty clueless. It’s as if she’d never seen a non-white person before.
228, It’s dark. I’m walking home alone. A white guy comes towards me. We near each other and I tense, but I square my shoulders and stand tall. Just as I think I’ll be ignored, he jerks his head towards me and yells, “Nihao! Aiyaiyaiyai!” I jump. Part of me wants to yell back but fear takes over and I don’t (I never do). I AM Chinese, and English is my first language. My command of English is good enough for the courts of England and Wales. Yet, every other day someone goes out of their way to fling nonsensical words in a variety of languages I don’t even speak, in my direction.
229, I received my voter registration card in the mail and realized that under race it said “Hispanic” instead of “Asian”. I checked my drivers license and there is nothing regarding my race. Clearly, the state of South Carolina decided to label me by my last name and picture.
230, At the Grand Ole Opry hotel in Nashville TN, facilitating a conference. While navigating this huge and confusing hotel, I stopped to read the signs, probably with a dumbfounded look on my face. Two elderly, silver-haired, and very polite white women asked me (49 y/o, black man, Mississippi born and raised, PhD student), “Can you read?” I responded, “Yes, ma'am, very well.” When these things happen, I always have a better response…once the moment is gone.
231, Today at the elementary school where I work:A kid on the phone w/ a parent, was speaking a different language, is asked by a (white male) staff “Are you talking to someone or just making noises?” and proceeds to laugh and looks over at me and the person sitting next to me, as if he wanted us to laugh along with him. So I look him dead in the face like -____- (with no laughter) and turned to the person sitting next to me and said loud and clear “do you know what Microaggression is!?”
232, Was just told that it was awesome seeing “someone like you” singing along to my brother Jeff karaokeing Springsteen’s “Born to Run.” Thanks for reminding me how much I have to let slide on a daily basis.
233, I am on a date with a White guy, and it’s my very first date, ever. I’m nervous because I think he’s gorgeous. He tells me that I’m pretty for a Black girl. ) :
234, I heard that some guy who goes to my uni (who I don’t even know) refers to my friendship group as ‘Eastern Promises’.
235, We were watching a video in class, and it had language options. I was happy to see Korean, written in Korean, on that list, but someone asked, “Can we watch it in Chinese?” and pointed at the Korean. He then called me stupid when I corrected him, and no one, not even the teacher, told him off for calling me stupid. I’m Korean American, but in that moment, I felt stupid. I wished I hadn’t said anything at all.
236, My mother, who is African-American, was pregnant with me at the time. An older white woman asks what my mom had decided to name me to which my mother replies. The woman says, “You people come up with the most creative names!” I am named after a Shakespeare character.
237, PhD candidates and holders using the term “ghetto” to describe simplified or alternative means of doing things. (e.g. the “ghetto” way to conduct an experiment).
238, On going to visit my 85 year old, black grandmother for the first time after going natural.
239, I was walking through my neighborhood to get to a neighbor’s house. The houses in my neighborhood are cookie cutter model homes and the majority of people who live in the development are white. I’m not.
240, A girl in my class states that she is dyscalculic, which is the number equivalent of dyslexia. White guy says, “"Oh, you just want to prove that you don’t fit the stereotype. Why would you be so negative about yourself like that, it’s not cool to act dumb just because you don’t want to be stereotyped.”
241, So after tipping you $2 on a $5 beer and smiling and being cheerful, I line up second to get my second drink. You flirt with the cute white guy in front of me, serve him a drink with a smile, then instead of asking the second person in line, me, you dive to the third guy right behind me, who happens to be another tall white guy. I know bars can be frustrating and stressful on a bartender, but this one was barely half full. I know I’m privileged enough to be even writing this, but sometimes I don’t know how else to respond to these acts of microaggressions. I’m too hurt to even be angry. I just wish people would be more mindful sometimes; I know you didn’t mean it and I’m probably overreacting and should have a thicker skin, but these things really get to me sometime…. :( I’m a gay person of color. Made me feel hurt. Uncomfortable. Reflective.
242, I was having dinner with two white, female friends (I am hispanic and male). The subject of a gospel music show came up and one of my friends said that BET (Black Entertainment Television) is “the worst thing to happen to black people in recent years).” Made me feel as if my friends don’t care about the issues that affect various groups in this America.
